# CITY EXPLORER API

# Project Name

**Author**: Andra Steele

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

In this lab assignment, you will begin building your own custom API server, which will provide data for the City Explorer front-end application. This means users will get to see not only the map, but also interesting information about the area, provided by a variety of third-party APIs that your server will manage.

## Getting Started

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
